This repo originally intended to host my answers to the exercies for the
book by Sutton & Barton, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

A free pdf can be
found [here](http://people.inf.elte.hu/lorincz/Files/RL_2006/SuttonBook.pdf)

But now it has become more like a place for my own notes on anything related to ML/stats.

Note: if you find the formatting some notebooks (esp. with many equations)
doesn't look good on github,, try visualize them on
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zyxue/sutton-barto-rl-exercises/tree/master/.
